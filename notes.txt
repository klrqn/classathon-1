Intermediate classathon 1:

Create 4 functions to solve the following Algorithms:

Recreate the following algorithms from Free Code Camp in C additional bonus if you use command line arguments to get the inputs.

1.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/factorialize-a-number
Your function should return a long long and accept one int
Function name: factorialize

2.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers
Your function should return an Int and accept one int
Function name: sumFibs

3.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/sum-all-primes
Your function should return an Int and accept one int.
Function name: sumPrimes

4.
Create the following algorithm function:
Should print a result then return an integer code
Function name: strContains

Inputs: 2 strings

If the 2nd string does not exist inside the first stringz then print:
“The string does not exist”
Then return the integer 0
If the 2nd string exists inside the first string print:
“The string exists”
Then return the integer 1
Ignore case.
Hacker level:
If the string contains the word more than once print:
“This string is full of the word”
Then return the integer 2

Sample tests:

“endangered” “end” true
“endangered” “danger” true
“the dog sleeps in the dog house” “Jack” false
“the dog sleeps in the dog house” “dog” true (hacker multiple)
Hacker level 2: Confirm case
“The dog sleeps in the dog house” “The” single true
“The dog sleeps in the dog house” the” single true
“The dog sleeps in the dog house” “dog” multi true

Create a repo: Intermediate classathon 1
Push these items to github and submit the repo link.
25 minutes if you can look at your free code camp code. 40 minutes if not.
